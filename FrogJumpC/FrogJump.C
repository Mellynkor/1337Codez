My mother told  me
Son
You better have faith
Cause its the one thing
Thatll help you escape
To a higher place

Sweet nightmares
Are all that's left
Whispered words between life and death's
Embrace
Faceless in a shadows
Guise
Striving toward our demise
School shooters
Looters and riots
Met with
Silence
Media lies and sensationalizes 
The sensations of hatred
And violence

Every fuckin' day
It's a new fuckin' thing
Eyes glazed over glued to screens

I'm sick I'm tired
Of all this shit
If you feel the same
Then mosh with it

They say sweet dreams are made of this
